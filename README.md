# 🎯 Number Guessing Game

This is a simple **Number Guessing Game** written in Python. The program selects a secret number, and the user tries to guess it. The game gives feedback on whether the guess is correct, and continues until the user wins or exits.

## 🚀 How It Works

- The computer picks a secret number.
- The user is prompted to guess the number.
- If the guess is correct, the game congratulates the user.
- If the guess is wrong, the user is asked to try again.
- The game loops until the user guesses correctly or quits.

## 🧠 Skills Practiced

- Python `input()` and `print()` functions
- Conditional statements (`if`, `else`)
- Loops (`while`)
- Basic error handling

## 🖥️ Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Works in any terminal or IDE (like PyCharm)
